Step by Step 3D Printing Visualizer
============

A web-based 3D viewer for [GCode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code) files. This allows you to 
view the actions a 3D printer will take instruction by instruction, layer by layer based on input
from a G-code file. 

Built using WebGL, [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/), and [svg.js](https://github.com/wout/svg.js).
